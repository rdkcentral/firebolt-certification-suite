Feature: Device

    Background: Launch FCA for 'Device'
        Given the environment has been set up for 'Device' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched

    @Device @coreSDK @sdk @transport
    Scenario Outline:Device.<Method> - Positive Scenario: <Scenario>
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<API_Key>'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with '<Validation_Key>'
        Examples:
            | Scenario                    | API_Key                  | Validation_Key              | Method      |

            | Validate Device make        | fetch device make        | expected device make        | make        |

    @Device @coreSDK @sdk @transport
    Scenario: Device.name - Positive Scenario: Validate device name change
        When '3rd party app' registers for the 'device onNameChanged' event using the 'Firebolt' API
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'get device name'
        And 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'set device name to living hall'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds to '1st party app' for 'set device name to living hall'
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'get device name'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with 'living hall for device name'
        And 'Firebolt' platform triggers event 'onDeviceNameChanged with living hall'

    Scenario Outline: Device.<Method> - Positive Scenario: <Scenario>
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<API_Key>'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with '<validation_key>'

        Examples:
            | Scenario                  | Method           | API_Key                | validation_key            |

    Scenario: Device.onNameChanged - Positive Scenario: Clearing event listeners
        When '3rd party app' registers for the 'device onNameChanged' event using the 'Firebolt' API
        And I clear 'device onNameChanged event' listeners
        And 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'set device name to kitchen'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds to '1st party app' for 'set device name to kitchen'
        And 'Firebolt' platform does not trigger event for 'onDeviceNameChanged'

    Scenario Outline: Device.network - Positive Scenario: <Scenario>
        When '3rd party app' registers for the 'device onNetworkChanged' event using the 'Firebolt' API
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'fetch device network'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with '<Method_Validation_Key>'
        When User triggers event with value as '<Event_Params>'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform triggers event '<Event_Validation_Key>'

        Examples:
