    Scenario Outline: Metrics.<Scenario> - Positive Scenario: Validating rpc method metrics <Scenario>
        Given the environment has been set up for 'Metrics' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<API_Key>'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with '<Validation_key>'

        Examples:
            | Scenario | API_Key                             | Validation_key              |
            | ready    | notify that app is minimally usable | true for ready in metrics   |
            | signIn   | log a sign in event                 | true for signIn in metrics  |
            | signOut  | log a sign out event                | true for signOut in metrics |

        Given the environment has been set up for 'Metrics' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched
