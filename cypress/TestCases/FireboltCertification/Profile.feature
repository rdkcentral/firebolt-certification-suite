    Scenario Outline: Profile.approveContentRating - Positive Scenario: <Scenario> without UI
        Given the environment has been set up for 'Profile' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched
        And Framework registers 'pinChallenge' test provider
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'verify if current profile have access to content'
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'fetch lifecycle state'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with '<Content>'
        And 'Firebolt' platform responds with 'expected lifecycle state as foreground'

        Examples:
            | Scenario       | Content                                |
            | Correct-PIN    | true for profile approveContentRating  |
            | Wrong-PIN      | false for profile approveContentRating |

        And User validates lifecycle history for '3rd party app' with 'background:foreground'
