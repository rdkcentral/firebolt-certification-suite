Feature: UserInterest

    @initialization
    Scenario: Launch FCA for 'Userinterest'
        Given the environment has been set up for 'Userinterest' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched

    @coreSDK @sdk @transport @userinterest
    Scenario Outline: Discovery.userInterest - Positive Scenario: In-app UX - Notify userInterest with type <Scenario>
        When 1st party app registers for the 'Content onUserInterest' event using the 'Firebolt' API
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'notify userInterest with <userInterestData>'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with 'null for discovery userInterest'
        And 'Firebolt' platform triggers to '1st party app' event 'onUserInterest with <Event_Content>'
