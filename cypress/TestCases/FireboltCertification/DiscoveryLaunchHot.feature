    Scenario: Launch FCA for Discovery.Launch Hot Launch
        Given the environment has been set up for 'DiscoveryLaunch' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched
        And Test runner waits for 10 'seconds'
        And '3rd party app' transitions to state 'foreground'
        And '3rd party app' registers for the 'discovery onNavigateTo' event using the 'Firebolt' API

    Scenario Outline: Discovery.Launch Hot Launch - Positive Scenario: <Scenario> intent and app in foreground
        Given the environment has been set up for 'DiscoveryLaunch' tests
        When 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<Discovery_Launch_Key>'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds to '1st party app' with 'true for discoverylaunch'
        When Test runner waits for 30 'seconds'
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'fetch lifecycle state'
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with 'foreground for lifecycle state'
        And 'Firebolt' platform triggers event '<Event_Content>'
