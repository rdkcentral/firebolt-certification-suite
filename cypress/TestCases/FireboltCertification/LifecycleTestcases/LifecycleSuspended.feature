        # And 1st party app invokes the API to 'get lifecycle management state'
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'unsuspend app'
        # And 1st party app invokes the API to 'get lifecycle management state'
        Then '3rd party app' is in '<state>' state
        # Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with 'message and code for lifecycle unsuspend'

        Examples:
            | state        |
