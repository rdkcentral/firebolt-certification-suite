    Scenario: Lifecycle R*2.6.1 App should subscribe to onSuspended listener regardless of capability
        Given the environment has been set up for 'lifecycle' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched with 'foreground' state
        When '3rd party app' registers for the 'lifecycle onSuspended' event using the 'Firebolt' API

    Scenario: Lifecycle R*2.5.3 Cannot Suspend a unloaded App
        Given the environment has been set up for 'lifecycle' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched with 'unloaded' state
        When '3rd party app' transitions to state 'suspended'

    Scenario: Lifecycle R*3.2.5 Cannot relaunch Suspended App
        Given the environment has been set up for 'lifecycle' tests

    Scenario Outline: Lifecycle R*2.6.5 Cannot Suspend <state> app
        Given the environment has been set up for 'lifecycle' tests

    Scenario: Lifecycle R.3.3.4 Cannot Close Suspended App
        Given the environment has been set up for 'lifecycle' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched with 'suspended' state
        # And 1st party app invokes the API to 'get lifecycle management state'
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'close app with remote button'

        # And 1st party app invokes the API to 'get lifecycle management state'
        And '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'unsuspend app'
        # And 1st party app invokes the API to 'get lifecycle management state'
        Then '3rd party app' will stay in '<state>' state
        # Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with 'message and code for lifecycle unsuspend'

        Examples:

    Scenario: Lifecycle R.3.5.3 Try to suspend an app that doesn't exist
        Given the environment has been set up for 'lifecycle' tests
        # And 1st party app invokes the API to 'get lifecycle management state'
