        When 1st party app registers for the 'pinChallenge onRequestChallenge manage' event using the 'Firebolt' API
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'profile approvePurchase'
        And Fetch response for 'pinChallenge onRequestChallenge' event from 1st party app
        And 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'request focus for pinchallenge provider'
        And 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to 'send response from pinchallenge provider'
        And Fetch response for 'profile approvePurchase' method from 3rd party app
