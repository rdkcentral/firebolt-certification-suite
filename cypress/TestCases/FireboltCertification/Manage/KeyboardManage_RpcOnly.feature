    Scenario Outline: Keyboard.<Scenario> - Positive Scenario: Validating rpc method
        Given the environment has been set up for 'Keyboard-rpc-Only' tests
        And 3rd party 'certification' app is launched
        When 1st party app registers for the '<ManageEventName>' event using the 'Firebolt' API
        When '3rd party app' invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<MethodParam>'
        And Fetch response for '<EventName>' event
        And 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<FocusMethod>'
        And 1st party app invokes the 'Firebolt' API to '<ResponseMethod>'
        And Fetch response for '<MethodName>' method
        Then 'Firebolt' platform responds with '<MethodResponse>'
        Examples:
            | Scenario          | ManageEventName                   | EventName                  |  MethodName        | MethodParam                                              | FocusMethod                | ResponseMethod                | MethodResponse        |
